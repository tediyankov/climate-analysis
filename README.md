# Climate Analysis Toolkit

This is a set of python scripts designed to analyse climate datafiles.

If you are interested in collaborating, email me at teodor.yankov@new.ox.ac.uk 

To install a copy of the toolkit, open a terminal and run:
```
    git clone git@github.com:smangham/climate-analysis.git
```

**This code is currently in development and not all features will work**
